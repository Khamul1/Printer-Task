# Printer-Task
Robot
I am studying in Java-begin courses

When trying to print in the printer:

output the text to the console: “Text sent to print: text, length: length“
The printer can print if:

there is enough paint for the required number of characters
if there is not enough paint, display the message “There was not enough paint: left (total ink in the printer volume)”
After refilling the printer paint:

output text: “The printer is replenished by the length of the text charge (total ink in the printer: paintVolume)”
After successful printing:

the amount of ink should decrease by the length of the text (subtract from the point Volume variable)
output the text: “The text is printed: text, the printer has paint left: paintVolume“
